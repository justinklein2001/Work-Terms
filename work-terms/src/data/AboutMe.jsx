    paragraph: "Describing who I am is difficult to do in a lonesome paragraph, but I’m willing to give it a go. I’m a software engineer, and I love challenges. I seek out opportunities that I know will be difficult and require a lot of effort, because I’m addicted to hard work. Any challenge I overcome makes me a better engineer, and I want to be the best. Outside of my love for technology, I also love to play guitar, write, exercise and explore the outdoors. I have an amazing ability to deliver exceptional work while also being extremely outgoing and easy to communicate with. ",

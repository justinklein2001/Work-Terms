    about: "The Heart & Stroke Foundation is a not-for-profit organization that leads the fight in Canada against heart disease, stroke and related conditions. I worked in the IT & Bus department at the Ontario headquarters, located in downtown Toronto. I had hands-on experience developing the Direct Mail Donation Form campaign during this 4-month long work term.",
    goal1: "Strengthen my React, Node, CSS and Bootstrap skills",
    goal2: "Become more proficient with the business-related tasks that accompany the role of a web developer",
    goal3: "Conduct research about possible solutions to technical obstacles the foundation needs to overcome",
    goal4: "Strengthen my professional and presentation skills",
    goalParagraph: "I achieved all of my goals for this work term. I was able to get my hands dirty with every technology listed and had multiple opportunities to pursue and achieve my other goals.",
    description: "My main task for this work-term was to research, design, develop and implement a new Direct Mail Donation Form solution. I began the term by researching which tech stack would best suit the project’s needs (React.js, Node.js), and, once approved, worked diligently on it’s design and development. I needed to be able to adapt to new technologies I wasn’t familiar with quickly, so I could develop a working solution by the end of the term. I was able to do this with ease thanks to my skill of being highly adaptable to new concepts and tech stacks. My academic studies gave me the confidence in my own abilities that I would be able to deliver the solution the foundation needed from me. If I could code in C for two years, I knew I could learn React!",
    projectTitle: "The “DM” Donation Form",
    project1: "I was tasked with building a new “Direct Mail” donation form. The current version of the form was tied to a “no-code” solution that was no longer feasible. The foundation needed a completely standalone solution, using Moneris as the payment processor of choice. I pitched that we use React.js to build the front-end, Node.js for the back-end, and a MySQL DB to host constituent data. The foundation was in a transition phase with its CRM of choice so a standalone DB was the “band aid” solution dreamt up. This tech stack was approved, and I began  teaching myself React.js, Express.js and Bootstrap. I also became intimately familiar with how to handle API calls to various sources, how to “fill in the gaps” that terrible documentation won’t give you, and I learned how to be a true full-stack developer. I built the entire solution from scratch, by myself.",
    project2: "The form validates input fields on both the front-end and back-end, is able to accept monthly and one-time transactions, and logs all constituent data to a mySQL database. There is also rigorous error handling, and if any error does arise, nothing crashes, all the proper steps are taken, and the donor is alerted to the issue. I’ve never been more proud of a project than I am of this donation form. As my first work-term, it felt amazing to be able to deliver a working,",
    project3: "feasible and useful solution to my employers. Seeing what I’m truly capable of as a developer is the single best experience my Co-op journey has gifted me so far.",
    conclusions:"At my time at Heart & Stroke I had the opportunity to expand my tech stack by becoming proficient in React, Node and Bootstrap, and was given enough freedom and guidance to become a better developer. My ability to deliver a solution for the direct mail donation form gave me a new found confidence in my abilities as a developer. I would not have been able to achieve this without my amazing supervisor, Michael Turner, who allowed me to take the project in the direction I believed it needed to go and always supported my choices. Michael made me feel like the work I was doing was going to make a profound impact on the organization, and I will eternally be grateful for his guidance and support."

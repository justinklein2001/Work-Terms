    description: "As a full stack developer on the SEM Dev team, I developed new tools, fixed bugs and improved features for various repositories related to my team’s core product offerings.

It also afforded me the opportunity to strengthen my understanding of React and introduced me to TypeScript. Sapphire also has the best local development environment I’ve had the privilege to work with. This really allowed me to spend more time developing and less time obsessing over tedious local debugging.",
    conclusions:"My work term at Adknown proved to be the most challenging and most fulfilling work term of my Co-op career. I worked in a supportive and fun team, where each member felt like a mentor and a genuine friend. Cyan was an amazing senior mentor who always took the time to make sure I had the resources I needed to really succeed. She was also incredibly kind. Jacob was someone who always made me laugh uncontrollably on in-office days, and Alex was a team lead who would go to no end to protect and lift up his team. The SEM Dev team is truly something special. Working on this team humbled me and made me grow both as a developer and as a person. I’m truly grateful to have had the opportunity to be a part of it."
